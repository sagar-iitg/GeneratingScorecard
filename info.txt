6. use regular expressions for processing each line of the text commentary
7. read the two files 194161013-match-id-scorecard-published.txt
 and 194161013-match-id-scorecard-computed.txt
8.Compare the output scorecard obtained by program with the published scorecard.
9.Identify the differences between computed scorecard and the published scorecard
10.Print the difference in a readable format
11. Print the total number of mismatches in each match





Note: I have hardcoded matchId's of 10 matches by passing them from a list
for which the program runs fine.(As I have formatted those 10 files by doing some preprocessing)
Running all the match files by including matchId's in the list at the top of 194161016_q1.py
program will throw exceptions as the program cannot handle unformatted files.
(I have not done preprocessing for the rest of the files.Just included them in the directory)
